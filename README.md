# This repo is solely for learning and testing various git functionality.

# My todo list -
#
#   1) Refresh my Git skills
#   2) Contrast how Git works compared to CVS and RCS
#   3) Expand my knowledge of Git
#   4) Learn some more advanced Git features
#
# Eventually this will be integrated into a CI/CD Jenkins server
